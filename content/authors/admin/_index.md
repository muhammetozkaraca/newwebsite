I am a recent graduate of the Political Science Master program at Central European University in Vienna. I am interested in the subjects of armed conflicts, terrorism studies, religion and politics, as well as political methodologies with more than 2 years of experience in related fields. Previously, I held a couple of research assistant positions in academia and interned at national and international think tanks. Throughout these occasions, I gathered experience in conducting literature reviews, preparing and drafting written works, gathering background information, along with cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data in R and Python. I also occasionally use the MS Excel program for data analysis purposes.

On this website, you can find my master’s thesis, which I submitted to the Department of Political Science at Central European University in June 2021. If you are interested in my background, please feel free to look at my academic {{< staticref "uploads/CV-Academic.pdf" "newtab" >}}resumé,{{< /staticref >}} and professional {{< staticref "uploads/CV.pdf" "newtab" >}}resumé{{< /staticref >}}.

I hope you have a good day full of enjoy.
