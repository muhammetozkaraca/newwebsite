I am a recent graduate of the Political Science Master program at Central European University in Vienna. I am interested in the subjects of armed conflicts, terrorism studies, religion and politics, as well as political methodologies with more than 2 years of experience in related fields. Previously, I held a couple of research assistant positions in academia and interned at national and international think tanks. Throughout these occasions, I gathered experience in conducting literature reviews, preparing and drafting written works, gathering background information, along with cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data in R and Python. I also occasionally use the MS Excel program for data analysis purposes.

On this website, you can find my master’s thesis, which I submitted to the Department of Political Science at Central European University in June 2021. Additionally, you can also view some of my selected short essays, which I wrote for [GazeteBilkent](http://www.gazetebilkent.com/author/676/) during my undergraduate studies. However, please be aware that their texts are in Turkish, although I intend to revise and translate them as soon as I can to reach a wider audience. 

If you are interested in my background and my research interests, you can find my CV on the website. You can also reach me via muhammetozk@icloud.com.

I hope you have a good day full of enjoy.
